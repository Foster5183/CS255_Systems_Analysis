# CS255_Systems_Analysis
A course covering the systems development life cycle in SNHU CS255 
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was completed for DriverPass inc, a company aiming to reduce high failure rates in driving tests by providing an exhaustive online training platform for potential drivers. The system was designed to include an online training platform with courses and practice tests, as well as a regional-based booking system for scheduling on-road training sessions with certified instructors.

What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I did particularly well in defining the system's objectives and goals, ensuring that they were clear, measurable, and aligned with the client's needs. I also outlined the nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, platform constraints, and security, to ensure the system would function properly.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on the User Interface section. I would improve it by providing more detailed descriptions of the interface's layout, design elements, and user interaction. This would help ensure that the interface is user-friendly and meets the needs of different user roles, such as administrators, trainers, and students.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the client's objectives and the problem they wanted to solve. This involved understanding the importance of reducing driving test failure rates and providing accessible, effective training. I implemented these needs into the system design by ensuring the platform offered online training materials, practice tests, and a convenient booking system for on-road training. Considering the user's needs is critically important when designing a system because it ensures that the final product effectively addresses the problems and enhances the user experience.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I approach it by first understanding the client's requirements and the users' needs. I then define clear objectives and goals, outline the system components, and specify the functional and nonfunctional requirements. In the future, I would use techniques such as user stories, use case diagrams, and prototyping to analyze and design a system. These strategies help in visualizing the system's functionality, identifying potential issues early in the development process, and ensuring that the final product meets the users' expectations.
